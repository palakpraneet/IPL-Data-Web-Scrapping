# IPL-Data-Web-Scrapping-
This Project helps us to Extract all the Data of different players who played in IPL from ESPN Cricinfo website. It creates folders of different teams of the IPL and excel files for each of the players where we can have a record of all the data related to the players (runs, balls, fours.. etc).

This Project is made using JavaScript language. Cheerio module has been used for scrapping the website which is a Node.js library and helps working using j-Query like syntax. Data is being read and written in excel files using xlsx module of npm.

<--To run the code-->
